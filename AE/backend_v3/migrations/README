# Alembic Migrations Guide

This directory contains the Alembic migration environment and migration scripts for the backend_v3 project.

## Usage

### 1. Initial Setup
- Make sure you have copied `alembic.ini.example` to `alembic.ini` and updated the database connection string as needed.

### 2. Applying Migrations (Recommended for Most Users)
- To create all tables in a fresh (empty) database, simply run:

```sh
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```
- This will apply all existing migration scripts and bring your database schema up to date.

### 3. Creating a New Migration (For Developers)
- If you have made changes to the models and want to generate a new migration script, run:

```sh
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe your change"
```
- Then apply the new migration as above:

```sh
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

## Notes
- Do **not** run `alembic revision --autogenerate` unless you are developing and have made changes to the models/schema.
- For most users, only `alembic upgrade head` is needed to initialize or update the database.

For more details, see the main project README.
