# Historical Data Optimizations (Future)

## Data Retention
- Implement data retention policy to clean up old minute-level data
- Prioritize when data volume exceeds several months of historical data

## Database Views/Aggregations
- Create materialized views for commonly accessed time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Implement when query performance on aggregated data becomes an issue

## Additional TimescaleDB Features to Implement

### 1. Continuous Aggregates
- Create continuous aggregates for common time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Example implementation:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW historical_data_daily
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT 
  time_bucket('1 day', timestamp) AS day,
  instrument_id,
  first(open, timestamp) AS open,
  max(high) AS high,
  min(low) AS low,
  last(close, timestamp) AS close,
  sum(volume) AS volume
FROM historical_data
GROUP BY day, instrument_id;

-- Add refresh policy (refresh every day)
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('historical_data_daily',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '3 months',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');
```

### 2. Advanced Query Functions
- Implement gap filling for missing data points:
```sql
SELECT time_bucket_gapfill('1 hour', timestamp) AS hour,
  COALESCE(avg(close), LOCF(avg(close))) as avg_close
FROM historical_data
WHERE instrument_id = 1
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

### 3. Backfill and Data Management
- Create utility scripts for data backfill operations
- Implement background job for continuous aggregate maintenance

### 4. API Enhancements
- Add endpoints to leverage TimescaleDB's specialized functions
- Support time-weighted average calculations and interpolation
- Implement candlestick pattern recognition using time-bucketed data
