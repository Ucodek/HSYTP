- **Coverage targets**: End-to-end workflows, load testing

## Implementation Team Allocation

For optimal progress, the following team structure is recommended:

1. **Core Team** (Phases 1-3)
   - 2 Backend engineers (API development)
   - 1 Database specialist (data modeling and optimization)
   - 1 DevOps engineer (infrastructure part-time)

2. **Feature Team** (Phases 3-5)
   - 2 Backend engineers (financial features)
   - 1 Financial analysis specialist
   - 1 QA engineer

3. **Optimization Team** (Phase 6)
   - 1 Performance engineer
   - 1 Security specialist (part-time)
   - 1 Backend engineer

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1-2**: Infrastructure stability (uptime > 99%)
- **Phase 3**: API response time for core endpoints (< 200ms @ p95)
- **Phase 4**: Search relevance score (> 80%)
- **Phase 5**: Portfolio optimization accuracy vs. benchmark (< 2% variance)
- **Phase 6**: System performance under load (handles 100 req/sec with < 500ms latency)

By following this implementation sequence, the project will maintain a clear direction with tangible milestones while ensuring that dependencies are properly managed and core functionality is prioritized.
