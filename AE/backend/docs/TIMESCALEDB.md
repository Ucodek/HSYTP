# TimescaleDB Integration Guide

This document outlines the implementation, best practices, and maintenance for the TimescaleDB integration in our application.

## Overview

TimescaleDB is used for efficient storage and querying of time-series financial data, particularly for historical price information.

## Key Features Implemented

- **Hypertables**: Historical data is stored in TimescaleDB hypertables, which automatically partition data by time
- **Time Buckets**: Data aggregation using TimescaleDB's `time_bucket` function
- **Optimized Indexes**: Specialized indexes for time-based queries

## Features To Implement

- **Continuous Aggregates**: Precomputed aggregations for common time intervals
- **Compression Policies**: Automatic compression of older data
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic removal of very old data
- **Gap Filling**: Handling missing data points in time series

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

1. **Always include timestamp in queries**
   ```sql
   -- Good: Uses time partitioning
   SELECT * FROM historical_data WHERE timestamp > '2023-01-01' AND instrument_id = 1;
   
   -- Bad: Forces full table scan across partitions
   SELECT * FROM historical_data WHERE instrument_id = 1;
   ```

2. **Use time_bucket for aggregations**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     time_bucket('1 day', timestamp) AS day,
     AVG(close) as avg_price
   FROM historical_data
   WHERE instrument_id = 1
   GROUP BY day
   ORDER BY day;
   ```

3. **Leverage continuous aggregates for common queries**
   ```sql
   -- Instead of calculating on the fly every time
   SELECT * FROM historical_data_daily WHERE instrument_id = 1;
   ```

### Data Management

1. **Chunk Size**: Default chunk size is optimized for 1-2 weeks of data
2. **Compression**: Compress data older than 7 days
3. **Retention**: Consider dropping data older than 1-5 years depending on usage

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Maintenance

- Refresh continuous aggregates
- Run compression on eligible chunks
- Check for orphaned chunks

### Weekly Maintenance

- Reindex hypertables
- Run VACUUM and ANALYZE
- Update statistics

### Monthly Maintenance

- Apply retention policies
- Review and adjust chunk sizes if needed
- Audit access patterns for optimization opportunities

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Chunk count and size
- Compression ratio
- Query performance on time-based functions
- Cache hit rate for continuous aggregates

### TimescaleDB Tools

```sql
-- View hypertable information
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;

-- View chunk information
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.chunks;

-- View compression statistics
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.compressed_chunk_stats;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow queries**
   - Ensure proper time-based predicates
   - Check for appropriate indexes
   - Consider creating a continuous aggregate

2. **High disk usage**
   - Verify compression is working
   - Check retention policies
   - Review chunk size configuration

3. **Failed compression**
   - Ensure the TimescaleDB license supports compression
   - Check for locks preventing compression
